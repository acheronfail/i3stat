## The list of bar items. Ordered left to right in the bar itself.
#
## COMMON OPTIONS
## All items share the the following config options:
# type:   required; the type of the item
# name:   optional; a name for the item - makes some ipc operations easier
# index:  optional; where to position this item in the bar - defaults to the current index in `items`
# signal: optional; a real-time signal can be mapped to an item, and when istat receives this signal
#                   the item will be refreshed - useful for manually triggering item updates.
#                   The same signal can be used for multiple items.
#                   The `istat-signals` command can be used to query limits for signals on the
#                   current system.
#
## FLOAT FORMAT OPTIONS
## Some items which display a floating point integer allow customising its format with these options:
# pad:       optional; character to pad with. If not provided, no padding will be done
# pad_count: optional; how long to pad the number with. If not provided then it will pad to 3 digits
#                      before the decimal point.
# precision: optional; how many digits to display after the decimal point. Defaults to 0.
