# Ideas

This document is more or less a scratchpad for ideas of things to work on next.
There's no guarantee they'll ever be added or implemented, and they'll likely be half-baked!

* ...

## Bugs

* when devices with batteries are disconnected it crashes the battery item

## Improvements

* add an aarch64 build to github releases
* don't completely die if config is unrecognised (unknown item), just log an error and continue
