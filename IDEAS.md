### Nerd Fonts

Nerd Font icons come in two variants. If the font was called "A", the the variants are:

* "A Nerd Font"
* "A Nerd Font Mono"

The one with the "Mono" suffix has all the icons 'squashed' into a single monospace character's width.
This is a compatibility for programs that don't support double-width characters, but does make some of the icons appear too small.
